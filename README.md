# COMS327 Spring 2021 Project: Rogue-like Game
---

This repository contains all of the updates to the game as developed throughout the class.
Each subfolder (should) contain a working version of the game as specified by the requirements for that week.
The completed game is located within `jiang_jason.assignment-1.10`.
There are also tarballs of both my submissions and the professor solutions.
The "code" subfolder contains miscellaneous/unrelated code for notes and HackerRank code solutions.

To run each version of the game, just download the folder and use `make`.
