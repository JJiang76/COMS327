This program implements a modified Abelian Sandpile. The world is a 23x23 grid and includes sinks that do not allow sand to fall into that cell.

Each simulation step is printed after a grain of sand is dropped in the middle pile and any piles greater than 8 are toppled.

The program accepts optional parameters, called salt, in three-tuples in the form "y x h", where y and x are the coordinates in the grid where a sandpile of height h is dropped. Sinks are added with a height of -1. Sinks placed in the center are ignored.

The program also accepts a fps parameter triggered by passing "--fps" as the first parameter and a fps value as the second. The salt starts after. The default fps is 10.

Note: The program sometimes will not run, leaving a "Segmentation Fault (core dumped)" message. However, if you continue to try to run the program, it will eventually run. I am not sure why this happens.
I think this is fixed now ^
