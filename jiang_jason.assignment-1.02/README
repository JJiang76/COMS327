This program is part of a series of assignments with the end goal of creating a rogue-like game.

This program generates a dungeon to standard output. The user has optional switches he is
able to pass in order to load and save dungeons to and from the disk.

"--load": passing the load switch will load a dungeon from ~/.rlg327/dungeon

"--save": passing the save switch will save the current dungeon to ~/.rlg327/dungeon

Both switches are able to be passed. In that case, a dungeon is loaded, displayed, and
saved back to the disk.

If no switches are passed, the program randomly generates a dungeon and displays it
without saving.
