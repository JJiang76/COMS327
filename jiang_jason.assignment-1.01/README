This program is part of a series of assignments with the end goal of creating a rogue-like game.

This program generates a dungeon to standard output with the following attributes (basically matching the assignment criteria):
- The dungeon is 21 units in the y direction and 80 units in the x direction.
- The outermost cells are immutable.
- A minimum of 6 rooms and maximum of 8.
- A minimum room size of 4x3 and maximum of 8x9.
- Rooms and room sizes are randomly generated and placed.
- Corridors are generated to connect each room.
  - Corridors go from the top-left corner of one room to the top-left corner of another room.
  - Corridors are generated by starting in one corner and going in the y direction (up/down) until reaching the same y value of the second room, then going in the x direction (left/right) until reaching the corner of the second room.
  - A corridor is generated from the last room connected to the first, creating a cycle
- A minimum of 2 staircases (1 up, 1 down), and a maximum of 4. (2 up, 2 down).
- Every cell that is not one of the previously mentioned cells is "rock"
- A hardness level is randomly assigned to every cell.
- Special cells have hardness <= 0. (for implementation purposes, will change in future if necessary)
- The dungeon is displayed as follows:
  - '9' for the border; hardness = -1 (will be changed in the future once the character is used for the game)
  - '.' for room floors; hardness = 0
  - '#' for corridor floors; hardness = -2
  - '<' for up staircases; hardness = -3
  - '>' for down staircases; hardness = -4
  - ' ' (space) for rock; hardness 1-255
