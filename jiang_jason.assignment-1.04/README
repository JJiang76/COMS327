This program is part of a series of assignments with the end goal of creating a rogue-like game.

This program generates a dungeon to standard output. The dungeon is filled with monsters and a pc character.

The number of monsters can be passed in by a switch "--nummon", followed by the number desired.

The monsters are given random attributes and moves automatically according to them. The PC does not move.

The game ends if either the PC dies or all monsters die.
