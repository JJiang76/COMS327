This program is part of a series of assignments with the goal of creating
a rogue-like game.

!! There is a bug that causes the game to freeze occasionally
    caused by prof's 1.08 solution

The user is now able to pick up items and interact with them.
  - The user must press ',' to pick up an item.
  - The 'i' key displays the inventory. From there the user has a few options.
    - The 'w' key prompts the user to select an item to equip.
    - The 'd' key prompts the user to select an item to drop.
    - The 'x' key prompts the user to select an item to destroy.
    - The 'I' key prompts the user to select an item to display its description

  - The 'e' key displays the equipment.
    - From there the user can choose to dequip an item with the 't' key.

Combat is done using damage dice, hp, and equipment.
  - The PC damage is calculated by rolling every damage dice on each equipped
      item and adding to base roll
      - pc_dmg = sum(equipment[i]->roll()) + pc->damage->roll()
  - Monster damage is calculated by rolling its damage dice and subtracting
      the defense value of every equipped item by the PC
      - monster_dmg = npc->damage->roll() - sum(equipment[i]->damage)

The game ends with killing a monster with the BOSS tag (Spongebob).

The key 'L' allows the player to select a tile, and if there is a monster,
display its information.
