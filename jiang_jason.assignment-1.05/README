This program is part of a series of assignments with the end goal of creating a rogue-like game.

This program generates a dungeon to standard output. The dungeon is filled with monsters and a pc character.

The user is able to control the PC character, giving it commands to move with keystrokes.

The available commands are (from the assignment specs):

7 or y - Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper left.
8 or k - Attempt to move PC one cell up.
9 or u - Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper right.
6 or l - Attempt to move PC one cell to the right.
3 or n - Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower right.
2 or j - Attempt to move PC one cell down.
1 or b - Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower left.
4 or h - Attempt to move PC one cell to the left.
> - Attempt to go down stairs. Works only if standing on down staircase.
< - Attempt to go up stairs. Works only if standing on up staircase.
5 or space or . - Rest for a turn. NPCs still move.
m - Display a list of monsters in the dungeon, with their symbol and position relativeto the PC (e.g.: “c, 2 north and 14 west”).
up arrow - When displaying monster list, if entire list does not fit in screen and not currently at top of list, scroll list up.
down arrow - When displaying monster list, if entire list does not fit in screen and not currently at bottom of list, scroll list down.
escape - When displaying monster list, return to character control.
Q - Quit the game

If the user inputs a move that cannot execute (like running into a wall), a turn is not consumed.

The game ends either when the player dies or all the monsters die.
