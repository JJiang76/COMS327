This program is part of a series of assignments with the goal of creating a rogue-like game.

This program parses data from monster_desc.txt

The parsed data is stored in a vector of monster_desc objects.
  - monster_desc class can be found in parse.h
All of the logic for parsing, storing, and printing can be found in parse.cpp
  - parse() handles the io and storing the data into the monster_desc vector
  - print_desc() prints all of the data stored in the monster_desc vector to standard output
The dice class used to store data for speed, hp, and damage is in utils.h

The main method created a monster_desc vector v, and calls parse() and print_desc(),
passing in v, then immediately returns.
