This program is the final version (for now) of the rogue-like game.

NOTE: I have changed the .txt files for monster and object descriptions.
      The updated ones are in /description_files. Please put them into 
      your /.rlg327 folder before running the game.

  - Items stats and rarities have been adjusted to be a bit more balanced

- Combat
  - When a monster attacks the PC, the PC is able to mitigate damage. This is done by summing all defense values on equipment and the defense stat. Mitigation in this form cannot drop the attack value past 0.
  - When a monster attacks the PC, the PC has a chance to dodge the attack based on his Dodge attribute.
  - When the PC attacks a monster, the PC must pass a hit chance for the attack to connect. This is based on his Hit attribute.
  - When the PC attacks a monster, the PC has a chance to critically strike for double damage. This is based on the Crit attribute.

- Floors
  - The dungeon is now labeled with floor numbers.
  - PC starts at floor 0.
  - Maximum of 10 upper floors, unlimited amount of "basement" floors
  - Each floor going up from floor 0 has increasingly stronger monsters
    - Monster stats (hp, spd, atk) are scaled based on floor level
    - All basement floors have the same monster difficulty as floor 0
  - The PC may traverse floors in any order
  - Floor 10 holds the Princess of the Dungeon with no monsters 
  - Floors are not "remembered"

- New Win Condition
  - Game no longer ends with killing BOSS monster (Spongebob)
  - After the BOSS monster is killed, a key will "drop" (doesn't actually go in the inventory) that allows the PC to open the cage that the Princess is in
  - The game ends with rescuing the Princess.
  - If you reach floor 10 without the key, you may go back to earlier floors to find it.
