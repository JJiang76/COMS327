This program is part of a series of assignments with the goal of creating a rogue-like game.

This program enters the dungeon game loop.
  - The dungeon is now filled with monsters parsed from monster_desc.txt and
    objects parsed from object_desc.txt
  - The rarity of npcs/objects are used to determine spawns
  - 10 objects spawn on each floor
  - Artifact objects can only spawn in once
  - Unique monsters do not spawn again after killed
  - The game end with killing monsters with the BOSS tag (Spongebob)
  - IO messages for combat now display monster names instead of symbols
  - Item locations are remembered
